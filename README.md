GitHub Action for [Semantic Release][semantic-url]. 

## Usage
### Step1: Set any [Semantic Release Configuration](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration) in your repository.

### Step2: [Add Secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) in your repository for the [Semantic Release Authentication](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/ci-configuration.md#authentication) Environment Variables.

### Step3: Add a [Workflow File](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) to your repository to create custom automated processes.

#### Basic Usage:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Semantic Release
    uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v2
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

**IMPORTANT**: `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not have the required permissions to operate on protected branches.
If you are using this action for protected branches, replace `GITHUB_TOKEN` with [Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). If using the `@semantic-release/git` plugin for protected branches, avoid persisting credentials as part of `actions/checkout@v2` by setting the parameter `persist-credentials: false`. This credential does not have the required permission to operate on protected branches.

#### Private Packages

If you are using this action to publish to the npm [GitHub Packages Registry][github-packages-registry],
then make sure that you configure this in your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
  }
}
```

### Inputs
| Input Parameter   | Required | Description |
|:-----------------:|:--------:|-------------|
| semantic_version  | false    | Specify specifying version range for semantic-release. [[Details](#semantic_version)] |
| branches          | false    | The branches on which releases should happen.[[Details](#branches)]<br>Support for **semantic-release above v16**. |
| branch            | false    | The branch on which releases should happen.[[Details](#branch)]<br>Only support for **semantic-release older than v16**. |
| extra_plugins     | false    | Extra plugins for pre-install. [[Details](#extra_plugins)] |
| dry_run           | false    | Whether to run semantic release in `dry-run` mode. [[Details](#dry_run)] |
| extends           | false    | Use a sharable configuration [[Details](#extends)] |
| working_directory | false    | Use another working directory for semantic release [[Details](#working_directory)] |

#### semantic_version
> {Optional Input Parameter} Specify specifying version range for semantic-release.<br>If no version range is specified, latest version will be used by default.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Semantic Release
    uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v2
    with:
      semantic_version: 15.13.28  # It is recommended to specify specifying version range
                                  # for semantic-release.
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

*It is recommended to manually specify a version of semantic-release to prevent errors caused during the official semantic-release upgrade.*

#### branches
> {Optional Input Parameter} The branches on which releases should happen.<br>`branches` supports for **semantic-release above v16**.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Semantic Release
    uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v2
    with:
      semantic_version: 16
      # you can set branches for semantic-release above v16.
      branches: |    
        [
          '+([0-9])?(.{+([0-9]),x}).x',
          'master', 
          'next', 
          'next-major', 
          {
            name: 'beta', 
            prerelease: true
          }, 
          {
            name: 'alpha', 
            prerelease: true
          }
        ]
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

`branches` will override the `branches` attribute in your configuration file. If the attribute is not configured on both sides, the default is: 
```
[
  '+([0-9])?(.{+([0-9]),x}).x',
  'master', 
  'next', 
  'next-major', 
  {name: 'beta', prerelease: true}, 
  {name: 'alpha', prerelease: true}
]
```

See [configuration#branches](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration#branches) for more information.

#### branch
> {Optional Input Parameter} Similar to parameter `branches`. The branch on which releases should happen.<br>`branch` only supports for **semantic-release older than v16**.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Semantic Release
    uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v2
    with:
      semantic_version: 15.13.28
      # you can set branch for semantic-release older than v16.
      branch: your-branch
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

It will override the `branch` attribute in your configuration file. If the attribute is not configured on both sides, the default is `master`.

#### extra_plugins
> {Optional Input Parameter} Extra plugins for pre-install. 

The action can be used with `extra_plugins` option to specify plugins which are not in the [default list of plugins of semantic release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/plugins#default-plugins). When using this option, please make sure that these plugins are also mentioned in your [semantic release config's plugins](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration#plugins) array. 

For example, if you want to use `@semantic-release/git` and `@semantic-release/changelog` extra plugins, these must be added to `extra_plugins` in your actions file and `plugins` in your [release config file](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration#configuration-file) as shown bellow:

Github Action Workflow:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Semantic Release
    uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v2
    with:
      # You can specify specifying version range for the extra plugins if you prefer.
      extra_plugins: |
        @semantic-release/changelog@3.0.0
        @semantic-release/git
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

Similar to parameter `semantic_version`. *It is recommended to manually specify a version of semantic-release plugins to prevent errors caused.*

Release Config:
```diff
  plugins: [
    .
+   "@semantic-release/changelog"
+   "@semantic-release/git",
  ]
```

#### dry_run
> {Optional Input Parameter} Whether to run semantic release in `dry-run` mode.<br>It will override the dryRun attribute in your configuration file.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Semantic Release
    uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v2
    with:
      dry_run: true
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

#### extends
The action can be used with `extends` option to extend an existing [sharable configuration](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/shareable-configurations) of semantic-release. Can be used in combination with `extra_plugins`.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Semantic Release
    uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v2
    with:
      # You can extend an existing shareable configuration.
      extends: |
        @semantic-release/apm-config

      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

#### working_directory

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Semantic Release
    uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v2
    with:
      # You can select another working directory like a subdirectory for example.
      working_directory: ./code
